*AGGREGATION — Simple Explanation*

Definition (in simple terms):

Aggregation represents a “has-a” relationship where both objects can exist independently.

💬 Think of it like:

“A Teacher has Students” —
But if the Teacher resigns, the Students still exist.

So the relationship is weak — they’re connected, but not owned by each other.

✅ Example: Teacher — Student

A Teacher can have multiple Students,
but those Students can also exist without that specific Teacher.
